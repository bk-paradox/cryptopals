# cryptopals
Doing the http://cryptopals.com challenges and learning python.

The intent is to learn various cryptographic implementations and how to defeat them to gain a deeper understanding.
Going through the challenges will aide in this and gives me a project to work on for python

These will not be the most efficent nor correct way, so comments and suggestions welcome!
Try the challenges out yourself
